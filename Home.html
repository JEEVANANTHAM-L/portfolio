    <h1 class="home"> Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself.<br>
         Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself <br>
         so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try <br>
         to see what kind of image you have about me through my <br>self-description. 
         I hope that my impression about myself and your<br>impression about me are not so
         different. .
